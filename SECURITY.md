- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response timeline

- **Acknowledgement**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix or mitigation**: Dependent on severity, but we aim for 30 days for critical issues

### What to expect

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report promptly.
- We will work with you to understand and validate the issue.
- We will keep you informed of our progress toward a fix.
- We will credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Security Best Practices for Users

- Never commit AWS credentials to version control.
- Use `aws-assume` with SSO profiles to avoid long-lived access keys.
